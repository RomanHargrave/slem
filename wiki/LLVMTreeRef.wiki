=== SLEM LLVM Tree Reference ===

This reference has been designed to closely resemble the [http://http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html LLVM Assembly Language Reference Manual] where possible.

It is not intended as a full reference for the IR - but will hopefully provide some insight as to which classes to use to construct the various IR elements which will make up your LLVM program trees in SLEM.
